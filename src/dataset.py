# Now, the next part gets a little tricky. We need to find the nearest MRT station the HDB unit is located in using their geo-location coordinates (Latitude, Longitude). We will use another API to achieve this - the OneMap API.

# First let's create a list of all the MRT stations in Singapore.
# Since MRT stations change relatively slowly overtime, we can leverage a static list.
# I obtained the data from Wikipedia, which also provides data on upcoming MRT stations.
# We will only consider existing MRT stations for now.
